# Tree

## Problem 3

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following Node class

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}
```

The following test should pass:

```javascript
const node = new TreeNode(
  'root',
  new TreeNode('left', new TreeNode('left.left'), new TreeNode('right'))
);
expect(deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val).toEqual('left.left'); // Jest Testing
```

## Problem 8

This problem was asked by Google.

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1
```

## Problem 24

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

- is_locked, which returns whether the node is locked
- lock, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
- unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

## Problem 48

This problem was asked by Google.

Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]

And the following inorder traversal:

[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

You should return the following tree:

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g
```

## Problem 50

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    *
   / \
  +   +
 / \ / \
3  2 4  5
```

You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).

## Problem 80

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return d.

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d
```

## Problem 83

This problem was asked by Google.

Invert a binary tree.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \  /
d   e f
```

should become:

```
  a
 / \
 c  b
 \  / \
  f e  d
```

## Problem 89

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

A binary search tree is a tree with two children, left and right, and satisfies the constraint that the key in the left child must be less than or equal to the root and the key in the right child must be greater than or equal to the root.
